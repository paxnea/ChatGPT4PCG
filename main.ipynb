So, hypothetically, if we were to *embed instructions* on what to do for each of these 26 letters into the prompt, that should work. Unfortunately, these instructions are quite lengthy and thus the prompt will violate the 900-token size limit requirement. However, if we somehow manage to *compress* these instructions to a more reasonable size, we should be good to go. And so that's what we do here. This is definetely not prompt engineering but it works and technically complies with the contest rules."
